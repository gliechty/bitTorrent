### Intro to Bt

#### What is it?

##### In a word... peer to peer file sharing (the thing people did before everyone got lazy and just did Netflix for watchng movies). 

### What problem does it solve?

In a normal client-server model, with many clients requesting the same file from a server, a server will crash if it gets overloaded. It's a one-way sorta thing. Like any relationship, with no give-and-take, things get strained. But wait...if Bob has a file, and I want it, and a computer is basically a server, and there are millions of people who have the same file (on as many servers), and millions that want it...why not just distribute these requests equally to avoid overload? Starting to make a lot more sense, right?

But, why the 'bit'?

Well, BT clients manage a download of a larger file in pieces...hundreds at a time. This makes the whole transfer part easier. When I download a movie, the first 1/100th (or 1/200th) piece can be shareable as soon as I download it. To make the inevitable LOTR reference, this means you can start downloading the Fellowship of the Ring from my computer, as I'm watching it, before I even get to Bree.

Which leads us to...

### The Golden RULE!

Don't be a LEECHER.
